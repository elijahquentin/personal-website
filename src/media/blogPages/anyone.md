Anyone? is a first step of sorts for me. My goal is get better at mixing alt-rock / math rock - but as I was recording
I realized I have some different problems to solve first.

I can't mix alt-rock if I don't have guitar tones worth mixing. As well as bass tones. I went ahead and finished the
project, but I didn't spend too much time on it.

Sometimes you have to take the first step to figure out what your goal should be.
